I just want to informally and take your opinion about the current situation I am in


To wrap my whole journey in ey till now is--
for about four months we 7 ppl were on bench (for which you are already aware) and we were told that fidelity project might come in 
where in i did only trainings and in person sessions conducted by ey.
     after four months I was allocated a peroject in which things didnt go pretty well 
     
     if you are aware of what happened ---
         I was inducted into the NIC project on 5th august 
         but things didnt go pretty well as the expectation from the client was too unrealistic not 
         not even considering the fact that i was only about a week old into the project,
         because of which he shouted at me every now and then which i told to my engagement manager
         and finally at the management's discretion i was pulled out of the project after around 2 weeks
         

So i want your suggestion with this question of mine   
So now the question that i popping up in my mind is : Considering my situation 

will my probation be confirmed on time , extended or rejected and will I be getting a project within ncr considering
my current in capability to go out of station due to my family reasons
or should i take as a red flag and start looking out ?
       
if you dont mind can i put this on mail tou you too ?
giving me nightmares
